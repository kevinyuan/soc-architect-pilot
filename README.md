> Transforming SoC architecture exploration from months to minutes with AI

**Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è using AWS services for AWS Hackathon 2025**

## üé¨ Background

**The Opportunity:** The $600B+ semiconductor industry powers every smartphone, data center server, and autonomous vehicle. Chip design involves five phases (Architecture ‚Üí RTL ‚Üí Verification ‚Üí Physical Design ‚Üí Manufacturing), each taking months.

**Architecture Design** - the first phase where engineers define chip components and connections - is the most strategic decision point. It determines product success, locks in downstream costs ($5-10M+ if wrong), and requires CEO/CTO approval.

**The Critical Bottleneck:** Traditional SoC architecture design methodologies are **stuck in the Stone Age**. Companies can only explore 1-2 architecture variants due to months of research, design exploration, modeling, and simulation required per variant, forcing strategic bets with insufficient data.

## üèÜ Solution: SoC Pilot

SoC Pilot is the **"ChatGPT for chip architecture"** - the world's first AI-native platform transforming architecture design from months of research to minutes of conversation.

### Core Capabilities

- **Conversational Design Interface** - Natural language requirements capture using Amazon Nova Premier, eliminating months of manual specification writing
- **AI-Powered Design Space Exploration** - Generate and compare 10+ architecture variants in minutes, analyzing performance vs. power trade-offs automatically
- **Zero-Code Architecture Generation** - No SystemC/Verilog coding required, democratizing chip design for system architects and product managers
- **RAG-Based Component Intelligence** - Leverage organizational knowledge and industry best practices through intelligent component selection and recommendations
- **Real-Time Validation & Optimization** - Automated design rule checking (DRC) with AI-suggested fixes, catching critical issues before costly downstream phases

### Key Use Cases

1. **Concept Brainstorming** - Rapid "what-if" exploration without coding
2. **Design Space Exploration** - Evaluate 10+ variants, compare trade-offs (performance vs. power)
3. **Specification Generation** - Auto-generate detailed architecture specifications with beautiful and interactive architecture diagrams for executive review
4. **Feasibility Studies** - Quick validation, identify bottlenecks, make go/no-go decisions
5. **Risk Mitigation** - Catch issues early, automated DRC validation, AI-suggested fixes

## üéØ Target Customers

### Chip Design Companies (Upstream)
- **Fabless Houses**: Mobile processors, AI accelerators
- **IDM Companies**: Broad product portfolios
- **Value**: Faster iteration, consistent quality, capture best practices

### System Companies (Downstream)
- **Cloud/Data Center Providers**: Custom server processors, AI chips
- **OEM/ODM**: Consumer electronics, automotive
- **Value**: Strategic investment decisions, rapid proof-of-concepts

### Ecosystem Partners (Complementary, Not Competitive)
- **IP Vendors**: Early recommendations ‚Üí qualified leads
- **EDA Tools**: Better-defined inputs ‚Üí reduced rework
- **Foundries**: Process-optimized architectures ‚Üí earlier engagement

## üí° The Impact

### For Customers
